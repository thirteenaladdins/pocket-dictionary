Do you ever come across words that you recognize but can't quite remember the meaning of? It can be frustrating, especially when reading academic papers, articles, or books. That's where my Chrome extension comes in.

With my extension, you can easily save new words by right-clicking on them. The extension will store the definition and other details for later reference in a convenient popup window.

In the future, I plan to add even more features, including a search function, the ability to highlight previously saved words, and even a hover-over definition view for words you've previously saved. With my extension, you'll never have to worry about forgetting a word's meaning again.
